# Turning a Rough Start into a Learning Opportunity: Our 3-Hour Outage Postmortem
![Flogging a dead horse](post-mortem-meetings.jpg)
## Issue Summary

On **[Date]**, our initial version of the mobile payment application, developed by the e-payment company in Sudan, experienced a significant outage. This downtime, lasting from 2:00 PM to 4:30 PM (local time), occurred during peak usage hours. As a result, all mobile payment users were unable to process transactions, leading to considerable financial loss for the company.

**Root Cause:**  
Our system struggled to handle a sudden surge in transaction requests, leading to performance issues and causing the application to hang. Essentially, our app said, _"I’m outta here!"_ just when we needed it the most.

## Timeline

- **2:15 PM:** Monitoring alerts triggered, notifying us that the application was unstable and transactions were not processing.
- **2:20 PM:** Initial investigation began, focusing on querying transaction statuses and checking system logs.
- **2:30 PM:** Identified a Java error indicating that the application was down.
- **2:45 PM:** The issue was escalated to the application and system administration teams, who restarted the application as a temporary fix.
- **3:00 PM:** Escalation to the development and infrastructure teams for deeper analysis and resolution.
- **4:30 PM:** The system was stabilized, and the application was brought back online.

## Root Cause and Resolution

**Root Cause:**  
The primary issue was that our application wasn’t prepared to handle the volume of requests during peak times. The sudden influx of transactions overwhelmed the system, leading to the application hanging and ultimately crashing.

**Resolution:**  
To resolve the issue, we implemented a load balancer, increased storage capacity, and introduced clustering to distribute the load more effectively. This ensured that our application could manage high traffic without crashing, turning a near-disaster into a valuable lesson.

## Corrective and Preventative Measures

To prevent this from happening again, we’ve implemented the following improvements:

- **Performance Optimization:** We’ve enhanced our load balancer and increased server capacity.
- **System Monitoring:** We added more robust monitoring tools to alert us before performance issues escalate.
- **Database Management:** Improved our database indexing and query optimization to handle high transaction volumes.
- **Load Testing:** Regular load testing during peak hours to ensure the system can handle future spikes in traffic.

## Conclusion

While the outage was a tough experience, it provided invaluable insights into the limitations of our initial setup. Thanks to the quick actions of our team and the lessons learned, we’ve fortified our system, making it more resilient for future challenges.

We’re now better prepared than ever to support our users, ensuring that our mobile payment application remains reliable even during peak times.
