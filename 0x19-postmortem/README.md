# Postmortem Process

## Overview

A postmortem is a critical process conducted after an incident or outage occurs within a system. It aims to analyze the event, understand its root cause, and identify areas for improvement to prevent future occurrences. This document outlines the steps involved in creating a thorough and actionable postmortem report.

## Purpose

The primary purpose of a postmortem is to learn from incidents and apply those lessons to improve the system's resilience and performance. It helps the team to:

- Identify the root cause of the issue.
- Assess the impact on users and business operations.
- Determine the effectiveness of the response.
- Develop strategies to prevent similar incidents in the future.
- Document the incident for future reference and training.

## Structure of a Postmortem Report

### 1. Issue Summary

This section provides a concise overview of the incident, which includes:

- **Duration:** Specify the start and end times of the outage, including the timezone.
- **Impact:** Describe what services were affected, how users were impacted, and the percentage of users affected.
- **Root Cause:** Provide a brief summary of the root cause of the incident.

### 2. Timeline

The timeline provides a detailed sequence of events, including:

- **Detection:** Note when and how the issue was first detected (e.g., monitoring alert, customer complaint).
- **Actions Taken:** Describe the steps taken to investigate and mitigate the issue, including any system components that were checked.
- **Escalation:** Mention which teams or individuals were involved in resolving the incident.
- **Resolution:** Explain how the issue was ultimately resolved.

### 3. Root Cause and Resolution

This section dives deeper into the root cause of the incident:

- **Detailed Explanation:** Provide a thorough explanation of what caused the issue.
- **Resolution:** Describe the steps taken to fix the problem, including any immediate actions and longer-term solutions.

### 4. Corrective and Preventative Measures

In this section, outline the steps that will be taken to prevent similar incidents in the future:

- **Improvements:** Highlight areas of the system that can be enhanced or fixed.
- **Tasks:** Provide a specific list of tasks or actions that need to be completed (e.g., patching servers, enhancing monitoring, increasing capacity).

### 5. Lessons Learned

Reflect on the incident to determine what the team has learned:

- **What Went Well:** Identify aspects of the response that were effective.
- **What Could Be Improved:** Note any areas where the response could have been faster or more effective.
- **Next Steps:** Outline any follow-up actions needed to address lingering issues or improve the process.

## Best Practices for Postmortems

- **Be Blameless:** Focus on identifying system weaknesses rather than attributing fault to individuals.
- **Be Detailed:** Provide as much information as possible to ensure a comprehensive understanding of the incident.
- **Be Actionable:** Ensure that the recommendations and corrective actions are clear and achievable.
- **Follow Up:** Regularly review past postmortems to ensure that all recommended actions have been implemented and assess their effectiveness.
